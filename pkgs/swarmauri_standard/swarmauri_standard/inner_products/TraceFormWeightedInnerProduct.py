    A class implementing the weighted trace form inner product.

    This class provides functionality to compute the inner product of two matrices
    using a weighted trace method. The weight matrix modulates the trace computation
    by scaling each element of the matrix product before summing.

    Inherits From:
        InnerProductBase

    Methods:
        __init__(weight_matrix): Initializes the class with a weight matrix.
        compute(a, b): Computes the weighted trace inner product of matrices a and b.
        check_conjugate_symmetry(a, b): Checks if the inner product is conjugate symmetric.
        check_linearity(a, b, c): Checks if the inner product is linear in the first argument.
        check_positivity(a): Checks if the inner product is positive definite.
