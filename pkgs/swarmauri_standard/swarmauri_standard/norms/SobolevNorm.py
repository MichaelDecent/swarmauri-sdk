    """
    A class implementing the Sobolev norm, which combines the L2 norms of a function and its derivatives.

    The Sobolev norm is particularly useful for measuring the smoothness of functions by considering both the function and its derivatives up to a specified order. This norm is defined as the sum of the squares of the L2 norms of the function and its derivatives, raised to the power of 1/2.

    Attributes:
        order: The highest order of derivatives to include in the norm computation. Defaults to 1.

    Methods:
        compute: Computes the Sobolev norm of the given input.
        _compute_l2_norm: Helper method to compute the L2 norm of a function or its derivative.
