    Dice similarity coefficient implementation.
    
    The Dice similarity coefficient is a set-based similarity measure that
    calculates the overlap between two sets, defined as twice the size of the
    intersection divided by the sum of the sizes of the two sets.
    
    For multisets (where elements can appear multiple times), the formula
    accounts for the multiplicity of elements.
