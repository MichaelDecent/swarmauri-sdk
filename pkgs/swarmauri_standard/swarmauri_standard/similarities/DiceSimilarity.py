    """
    Concrete implementation of the Dice similarity measure for set-based comparisons.

    This class implements the Dice similarity coefficient, which measures the
    similarity between two sets based on their overlap. The Dice coefficient is
    defined as:

        Dice(a, b) = 2 * |a âˆ© b| / (|a| + |b|)

    where |a| and |b| are the cardinalities of sets a and b, respectively.
