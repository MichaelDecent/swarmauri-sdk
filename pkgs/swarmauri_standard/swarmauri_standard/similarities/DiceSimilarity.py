    """
    Provides the implementation for Dice similarity measure.
    
    The Dice similarity is an overlap-based set similarity measure that
    weighs the shared elements between two sets. It is particularly useful
    for comparing sets or multisets where the order of elements does not matter.
    
    The measure is computed as:
        Dice(x, y) = 2 * |x âˆ© y| / (|x| + |y|)
    
    This implementation supports both sets and multisets, handling each case
    appropriately by considering element counts in multisets.
