    """
    Concrete implementation of the SimilarityBase class for cosine similarity.

    This class provides a measure of similarity between vectors based on the cosine
    of the angle between them. It uses the dot product over the product of their
    magnitudes to compute the similarity score. The implementation ensures that the
    measure is bounded and provides necessary checks for reflexivity, symmetry,
    identity, and boundedness.
