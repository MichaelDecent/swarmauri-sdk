# Git VCS Integration

Peagen can store and manage artifacts inside a Git repository. The
:mod:`peagen.plugins.vcs` package exposes a small helper class
:class:`GitVCS` which wraps the `git` Python bindings. A default instance
is created via the ``vcs`` plugin group.

```python
from peagen.plugins.vcs import GitVCS, pea_ref, RUN_REF

# open or create a repository locally
vcs = GitVCS.ensure_repo("./repo")
# clone a remote repository if needed
vcs_remote = GitVCS.ensure_repo("./repo", remote_url="https://github.com/org/repo.git")
vcs.commit(["results.json"], "initial result")
run_ref = pea_ref("run", "exp-a")
vcs.tag(run_ref)
```

Git references follow the ``refs/pea/<kind>`` convention. Constants are
exported for common prefixes such as :data:`RUN_REF`, :data:`PROMOTED_REF`,
and :data:`KEY_AUDIT_REF`.

When fetching content from Git, a ``git+`` URL will be cloned to the
destination directory. Both branches and commit SHAs are supported via
``git+<url>@<ref>``.

Git filters store artifacts outside the repository. Run ``peagen init filter``
to write ``clean`` and ``smudge`` helpers. Pass ``--add-config`` to also store
the filter URI in ``.peagen.toml``. Builtâ€‘in filters include ``s3://`` via
``S3FSFilter`` and ``MinioFilter`` for MinIO endpoints.

Additional helpers let tasks create branches (``fan_out``), move refs
(``promote``), apply tags, or reset a working tree with ``clean_reset``.

Example::

    peagen init filter s3://mybucket

If no URI is provided the command defaults to ``s3://peagen`` using ``S3FSFilter``.
To enable the filter manually in an existing repository use the
following snippet::

    with r.config_writer() as cw:
        s = 'filter "minio-oid"'
        cw.set_value(s, "clean", clean_cmd)
        cw.set_value(s, "smudge", smudge_cmd)
        cw.set_value(s, "required", "true")
    (REPO_DIR / ".gitattributes").write_text(
        "peagen/** filter=minio-oid diff=minio-oid\n"
        "artifacts/** -filter -diff\n"
    )

The ``init project`` command accepts ``--git-remote`` to set an origin
URL during repository creation and ``--filter-uri`` to initialise a
filter. Use ``--add-filter-config`` to also write the URI to the
generated ``.peagen.toml``.

``peagen init repo`` can create a GitHub repository for you. Pass the
target as ``tenant/repo`` (where ``tenant`` is a user or organisation)
and supply a personal access token. The command also generates an
Ed25519 deploy key and registers it with the new repo so tasks can push
results via SSH.

Peagen tasks use the VCS when available. DOE expansions and Evolve jobs
create branches for each spawned run, allowing easy inspection of
intermediate results. The ``vcs`` plugin can also commit generated
files automatically.

When a repository is cloned via :class:`GitVCS`, the ``origin`` remote is
configured to fetch and push all ``refs/pea/*`` references automatically:

```
with r.config_writer() as cw:
    cw.set_value('remote "origin"', 'fetch', '+refs/pea/*:refs/pea/*')
    cw.set_value('remote "origin"', 'push', 'refs/pea/*:refs/pea/*')
```
