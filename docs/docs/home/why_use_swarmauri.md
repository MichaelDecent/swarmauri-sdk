## Common Use Cases

### AI Assistants
Build chatbots and virtual assistants with memory, tool use, and multi-turn conversations.

```python
from swarmauri import Conversation, HumanMessage, AgentWithTools

# Create a conversation
conversation = Conversation()
conversation.add_message(HumanMessage("Can you help me analyze this dataset?"))

# Create an agent with tools
agent = AgentWithTools(
    llm="gpt-4-turbo",
    tools=["calculator", "data_analyzer", "chart_generator"]
)

# Generate a response
response = agent.run(conversation)
print(response.get_last().content)
```

### Document Processing Pipelines
Create workflows for processing, analyzing, and extracting insights from documents.

```python
from swarmauri import Pipeline, CSVParser, TextSplitter, OpenAIEmbedding, SqliteVectorStore

# Create a pipeline for document processing
pipeline = Pipeline([
    CSVParser(),
    TextSplitter(chunk_size=1000),
    OpenAIEmbedding(),
    SqliteVectorStore(db_path="documents.db")
])

# Process documents
result = pipeline.run("data.csv")
```

### Research Assistants
Build AI systems that can research topics, summarize findings, and generate reports.

```python
from swarmauri import ResearchAgent, ResearchQuery

# Create a research agent
agent = ResearchAgent(
    search_tools=["web_search", "wikipedia", "scholar"],
    analysis_tools=["summarizer", "fact_checker"]
)

# Conduct research
research = agent.research(
    ResearchQuery("What are the latest advancements in fusion energy?")
)

# Generate a report
report = agent.generate_report(research)
print(report)
```

### Multi-modal Applications
Develop applications that work with text, images, audio, and other data types.

```python
from swarmauri import MultimodalAgent, ImageInput, AudioInput

# Create a multimodal agent
agent = MultimodalAgent()

# Process different input types
text_response = agent.process_text("Describe this image")
image_response = agent.process_image(ImageInput("image.jpg"))
audio_response = agent.process_audio(AudioInput("recording.mp3"))
```
