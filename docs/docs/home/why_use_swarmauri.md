# Why Use Swarmauri

## Overview

Swarmauri SDK is a comprehensive and modular toolkit for building AI-powered applications that require seamless integration of multiple models, tools, and services. Whether you're building a simple chatbot or a complex AI agent system, Swarmauri provides the building blocks to accelerate your development while maintaining flexibility and control.

!!! info "What is Swarmauri?"
    Swarmauri is an SDK designed to simplify AI application development by providing a unified interface to various AI models and tools. It emphasizes type safety, modularity, and production readiness.

## Core Advantages

### Modular Architecture

Swarmauri is built on a highly modular architecture that allows you to use only what you need. Each component can be used independently or combined with others, making it easy to start small and scale up as your requirements grow.

### Unified API

Work with different AI models, embeddings, and tools through a consistent interface. Whether you're using OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, or open-source models, the API remains the same, allowing you to switch providers without changing your application code.

!!! tip "Provider Switching"
    With Swarmauri's unified API, switching between model providers is as simple as changing a single parameter:

    ```python 
    # Using OpenAI
    llm = OpenAIModel(model="gpt-4-turbo")

    # Switch to Anthropic
    llm = AnthropicModel(model="claude-3-opus")

    # The rest of your code remains unchanged!
    ```

### Type Safety

Built with Python's type system and leveraging Pydantic, Swarmauri provides excellent IDE auto-completion, static analysis, and runtime validation, significantly reducing bugs and improving developer productivity.

### Production Ready

Swarmauri is designed for production environments with robust error handling, retry mechanisms, rate limiting, and other features that ensure reliability in real-world applications.

### Tool Integration

Build AI agents that can use tools to accomplish tasks:

- **Calculator tools** for mathematical operations
- **Web tools** for fetching content and searching the internet
- **Data analysis tools** for processing structured data
- **File manipulation tools** for working with various document formats
- **Jupyter notebook tools** for data science workflows
- **Custom tools** that you can easily build and integrate

!!! tip "Custom Tools"
    Creating your own tools is straightforward with Swarmauri. Extend the `ToolBase` class, register it with `@ComponentBase.register_type`, and implement the `__call__` method. See the [Custom Components](../guide/usage.md#creating-custom-components) section for examples.

### Data Processing

Process and analyze data efficiently:

- **Parsers** for extracting information from text and documents
- **Chunkers** for breaking down large content into manageable pieces
- **Vectorstores** for storing and retrieving embeddings
- **Document management** for organizing your data

### Agent Framework

Create sophisticated AI agents that can:

- Understand complex instructions
- Use tools to accomplish tasks
- Maintain context across multiple interactions
- Collaborate with other agents

## Common Use Cases

### Basic Conversational AI

Build simple chatbots that can engage in natural conversations with users.

```python
from swarmauri import Conversation, HumanMessage, SystemMessage, OpenAIModel

# Create a conversation with a system message
conversation = Conversation()
conversation.add_message(SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."))

# Initialize an LLM
llm = OpenAIModel(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

# Function to handle user input
def chat_with_bot(user_input):
    # Add the user's message to the conversation
    conversation.add_message(HumanMessage(content=user_input))

    # Generate a response
    llm.predict(conversation=conversation)

    # Return the latest response
    return conversation.get_last().content

# Example usage
response = chat_with_bot("What is artificial intelligence?")
print(response)
```

!!! example "Use Case: Customer Support Bot"
    This pattern can be used to create customer support chatbots that can answer common questions, guide users through troubleshooting steps, and escalate to human agents when necessary.

### Tool-Augmented Assistants

Create assistants that can use tools to perform calculations, fetch information, and more.

```python
from swarmauri import Conversation, HumanMessage, ToolAgent, OpenAIToolModel, Toolkit, CalculatorTool, RequestsTool

# Create a conversation
conversation = Conversation()

# Create a toolkit with various tools
toolkit = Toolkit(
    tools=[
        CalculatorTool(),
        RequestsTool()
    ]
)

# Create an agent with tools
agent = ToolAgent(
    llm=OpenAIToolModel(model="gpt-4-turbo"),
    toolkit=toolkit,
    conversation=conversation
)

# Ask the agent to perform a task
response = agent.exec("Calculate 25 * 16 and then fetch information about the weather in New York.")
print(response)
```

### Question Answering with RAG

Build systems that can answer questions based on your own documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

```python
from swarmauri import RagAgent, OpenAIModel, OpenAIEmbedding, SqliteVectorStore, Document, Conversation

# Create sample documents
documents = [
    Document(content="Paris is the capital of France and is known for the Eiffel Tower."),
    Document(content="Rome is the capital of Italy and home to the Colosseum."),
    Document(content="Tokyo is the capital of Japan and is the most populous city in the world.")
]

# Create a vector store and add documents
embedding_model = OpenAIEmbedding()
vector_store = SqliteVectorStore(embedding=embedding_model, db_path=":memory:")
vector_store.add_documents(documents)

# Create a conversation
conversation = Conversation()

# Create a RAG agent
agent = RagAgent(
    llm=OpenAIModel(model="gpt-3.5-turbo"),
    vector_store=vector_store,
    conversation=conversation
)

# Ask a question
answer = agent.exec("What is the capital of France and what is it known for?")
print(answer)
```

!!! warning "Vector Store Persistence"
    When using `:memory:` as the database path, the vector store will be lost when your application exits. For production use, specify a file path to persist your vector store.

### Document Processing

Process and analyze documents to extract insights and make them searchable.

```python
from swarmauri import Document, TextSplitter, OpenAIEmbedding, SqliteVectorStore

# Create a document
document = Document(content="""
Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by humans or other animals.
AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, understanding human speech, self-driving cars,
automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems.
""")

# Split the document into chunks
chunker = TextSplitter(chunk_size=100)
chunks = chunker.split_document(document)

# Create embeddings for the chunks
embedding_model = OpenAIEmbedding()
embeddings = [embedding_model.embed_query(chunk.content) for chunk in chunks]

# Store the embeddings in a vector store
vector_store = SqliteVectorStore(embedding=embedding_model, db_path="ai_documents.db")
vector_store.add_documents(chunks)

# Search for relevant information
results = vector_store.similarity_search("What are examples of AI applications?", k=2)
for doc in results:
    print(doc.content)
```
