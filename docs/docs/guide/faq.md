## Troubleshooting Tips

### Import Errors

If you encounter `ModuleNotFoundError`:

```bash
# Ensure Swarmauri SDK is installed
pip list | grep swarmauri
```

!!! warning "Common Import Error Causes"
    - Package not installed correctly
    - Virtual environment not activated
    - Package installed in a different Python environment
    - Package name misspelled in the import statement

### Version Conflicts

If you face dependency conflicts:

```bash
# Create a fresh virtual environment
python -m venv fresh-env
source fresh-env/bin/activate  
# or fresh-env\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install swarmauri
```

!!! tip "Dependency Isolation"
    Consider using tools like Poetry or pipenv for better dependency management. These tools create lockfiles that ensure consistent environments across different machines.
    
    ```bash
    # Using Poetry
    poetry add swarmauri
    
    # Using pipenv
    pipenv install swarmauri
    ```

### Installation Fails

If installation fails with build errors:

```bash
# Install build tools
# On Windows:
pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel

# On macOS/Linux:
pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
sudo apt install build-essential  # For Ubuntu/Debian
```

!!! danger "Installation Troubleshooting"
    If you encounter persistent installation issues:
    
    1. Make sure your pip is up to date: `pip install --upgrade pip`
    2. Check if you have sufficient privileges (try using `sudo` on Linux/Mac or run as administrator on Windows)
    3. If you're behind a corporate firewall, you may need to configure pip to use an HTTPS proxy
    4. For C extension errors, ensure you have the appropriate compilers installed

## Usage Clarifications

### How do I use tools in Swarmauri SDK?

Swarmauri SDK allows you to integrate various tools to enhance the capabilities of your AI models.

```python
from swarmauri import Conversation, HumanMessage, SystemMessage, OpenAIToolModel, CalculatorTool, Toolkit

# Create a conversation
conversation = Conversation()
conversation.add_message(SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant with access to tools."))

# Create a toolkit with a calculator
toolkit = Toolkit(
    tools=[CalculatorTool()]
)

# Initialize an LLM with tool capabilities
llm = OpenAIToolModel(model="gpt-4-turbo")

# Function to handle user input
def ask_with_tools(user_input):
    # Add the user's message to the conversation
    conversation.add_message(HumanMessage(content=user_input))

    # Generate a response using the toolkit
    llm.predict(conversation=conversation, toolkit=toolkit)

    # Return the latest response
    return conversation.get_last().content

# Example usage
response = ask_with_tools("What is 25 * 16?")
print(response)
```

!!! info "Available Tools"
    Swarmauri SDK offers a variety of built-in tools including:

    - `CalculatorTool`: For mathematical operations
    - `RequestsTool`: For HTTP requests
    - `CodeExtractorTool`: For code extraction
    - `CodeInterpreterTool`: For python code execution
    
    You can also create custom tools by extending the `ToolBase` class.

### How do I create an AI assistant?

Create a simple AI assistant that can handle multiple tasks using different tools.

```python
from swarmauri import Conversation, HumanMessage, SystemMessage, OpenAIModel

# Create a conversation with a system message
conversation = Conversation()
conversation.add_message(SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."))

# Initialize an LLM
llm = OpenAIModel(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

# Function to handle user input
def chat_with_bot(user_input):
    # Add the user's message to the conversation
    conversation.add_message(HumanMessage(content=user_input))

    # Generate a response
    llm.predict(conversation=conversation)

    # Return the latest response
    return conversation.get_last().content

# Example usage
response = chat_with_bot("What is machine learning?")
print(response)
```

### How do I handle large datasets?

- **Chunking**: Break down large datasets into smaller chunks for processing.
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilize parallel processing to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Vector Stores**: Use vector stores for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.

```python
from swarmauri import (
    RagAgent,
    OpenAIModel,
    OpenAIEmbedding,
    SqliteVectorStore,
    Document,
    Conversation
)

# Create documents
documents = [
    Document(content="Paris is the capital of France."),
    Document(content="Berlin is the capital of Germany."),
    Document(content="Rome is the capital of Italy.")
]

# Create a vector store and add documents
embedding_model = OpenAIEmbedding()
vector_store = SqliteVectorStore(embedding=embedding_model, db_path=":memory:")
vector_store.add_documents(documents)

# Create a conversation
conversation = Conversation()

# Create a RAG agent
agent = RagAgent(
    llm=OpenAIModel(model="gpt-3.5-turbo"),
    vector_store=vector_store,
    conversation=conversation
)

# Ask a question
answer = agent.exec("What is the capital of France?")
print(answer)
```

## Performance Optimization

### How can I optimize the performance of my Swarmauri application?

- **Use Efficient Models**: Choose models that balance performance and accuracy for your use case.
- **Batch Processing**: Process data in batches to reduce overhead.
- **Caching**: Implement caching for repeated computations.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Use asynchronous operations to improve responsiveness.
