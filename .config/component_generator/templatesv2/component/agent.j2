I need you to generate a file named "{{ RENDERED_FILE_NAME }}". This file provides part of the edge layer for the "swarmauri_{{ RESOURCE_KIND }}_{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}" package.

Below are the details and requirements for this task:

1. **Purpose / Description**:
   {{ PURPOSE }}

   {{ DESCRIPTION }}

2. **Requirements / Constraints**:
   {{  REQUIREMENTS }}


3. **File and Code Preferences**:
   - The code should follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
   - Use clear docstrings and inline comments.
   - Assume the user will copy-paste this code as-is into their project.
   - Provide the concrete fully functional implementation of the code.

4. **Behavior**:
   - Must correctly inherit the base class and implement attributes.

### Desired Output
Produce a single code snippet that contains the entire content for the file {{ FILE_NAME }}. 
Do not wrap it in triple backticks! Just provide the raw code ready to copy-paste.
Do not provide an explanation afterward.

### Example Format of the Output
<!-- Example only; your code will vary. This is to show how your response should look. -->
{% include FILE_NAME %}


{# At the bottom of the template, include any dependency files specified by the DEPENDENCIES array #}
{% if RENDERED_DEPENDENCIES %}
### Dependencies
{%- for dependency in RENDERED_DEPENDENCIES %}
#### `{{ dependency }}`
```
{% include dependency %}

```

{%- endfor %}
{% endif %}
